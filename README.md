## Introduction
<p>
Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction System powered by Machine Learning and Streamlit! This application allows users to predict the likelihood of three major diseases: Diabetes, Heart Attack, and Parkinson’s Disease. On the home page, you can choose the disease you want to predict and access a dedicated prediction form for each one. Simply input the required health parameters, click the Predict button, and instantly view the results along with a clear health risk interpretation. Each prediction page is designed for ease of use, displaying both your input details and the prediction outcome. Additionally, the app ensures a smooth and informative user experience with a clean UI and fast real-time results. This tool serves as a helpful aid in promoting health awareness and early risk detection.

## Aim
<p>
   Title: Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Streamlit
</p>
<p> 
Aim: To develop a web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases (Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s) based on user health parameters.
</p>

## Objective
<p>
  Build an interactive and user-friendly prediction system that uses machine learning models to assess health risk for three diseases and provide real-time output through a web interface.
</p>

## Scope
<p>
  This project can be utilized in healthcare centers, diagnostic labs, or as an awareness tool for individuals to get preliminary health insights before clinical consultation.
